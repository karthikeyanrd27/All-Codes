* SSL can be configured for encryption or authentication. 
* Independly we can choose a seperate machianicm for client authentication. SSL, SASL 
* SSL - This is 2 way authentication.

SSL uses Private/key certificate pair : 

Each broker need its own private-key/certificate pair, client uses that certificate to authendicate the broker
Each logical client needs to own private-key/certificate pair if client authentication enabled

CA = Certificate Authority is reponsible for signinig certificate. = Passport authority 

Key store - each machine identity 
trust store - List of certificate that machine should trust
